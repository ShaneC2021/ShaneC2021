### What's Happening ?? ðŸ‘‹

I am Shane and I began my coding journey in May of 2021. I started my journey with [Roots Technology](https://rootstechnology.info/) based out of Texas and am currently working to become a fullstack developer with [getCoding](https://www.get-coding.ca/) based out of Newfoundland Canada. My occupational background is in mens competitive gymnastics.
